# Tools Overview

The following are the tools that are covered in Complete Machine Learning Package. They are popular tools that most machine learning engineers and data scientists need in one way or another and day to day. 

* [Python](https://www.python.org) is a high level programming language that has got a lot of popularity in the data community and with the rapid growth of the libraries and frameworks, this is a right programming language to do ML.

* [NumPy](https://numpy.org) is a scientific computing tool used for array or matrix operations. 

* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) is a great and simple tool for analyzing and manipulating data from a variety of different sources.

* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) is a comprehensive data visualization tool used to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org) is another data visualization tool built on top of Matplotlib which is pretty simple to use.

* [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): Instead of building machine learning models from scratch, Scikit-Learn makes it easy to use classical models in a few lines of code. This tool is adapted by almost the whole of the ML community and industries, from the startups to the big techs. 

* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) and [Keras](https://keras.io) for deep learning: TensorFlow is a popular deep learning framework used for building models suitable for different fields such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. Keras is a high level neural network API that makes it easy to design deep learning models. TensorFlow and Keras have a great [community](https://discuss.tensorflow.org) and ecosystem that include tools like [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard), [TF Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets), [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite), [TensorFlow Extended](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/), [TensorFlow Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub), [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js), [TensorFlow GNN](https://github.com/tensorflow/gnn), and [much](https://www.tensorflow.org/resources/models-datasets) [more](https://www.tensorflow.org/resources/tools).
